# Clockify extender Chrome extension

This extension slightly improves some aspects of the clockify.me site.

Currently working features:

* Adds decimal hours column after the HH:MM:SS column in dashboard view when clicking the extension button.
* In reports weekly view, adds decimal hours below (on big screens) or after (on small screens) the HH:MM:SS timestamp.
